# OpenGL_Scheisse
OpenGL Scheisse is only what the title claims it to be; a few developers messing with OpenGL libraries.
The end goal could be considered to be the creation of a graphics engine.

Library dependencies would be GLFW 3.1 for window context handling and GLEW for extension handling. All projects will be built in Visual Studio 2013 using x64 as the target architecture.
