# OpenGL_Scheisse
OpenGL Scheisse is only what the title claims it to be; a few developers messing with OpenGL libraries.
The end goal could be considered to be the creation of a graphics engine.

Library dependencies would be GLFW 3.1 for window context handling. All projects will be built in Visual Studio 2013 using x64 as the target architecture.


CHANGELOG:

v0.1
Original build. Consists of a simple main loop which refreshes the buffer of a GLFW context window.

Key callback of window checks for escape key and closes upon press thereof.
